== INPUT BOARD ==
- the board definition consists of three kinds of elements:
  - a decimal number indicating the number of rows in the gameboard
  - a decimal number indicating the number of columns in the gameboard
  - all the elments of the gameboard, which include:
    - decimal numbers indicating the proper number for the cell,
      optionally followed by a '+' to indicate that this number is
      a starting hint for the puzzle
    - strings of '.'s to indicate cells that should not be printed or
      considered in printing at all
    - strings of 'X's to indicate cells that should be printed as
      black space

The elements are arranged with the row and column counts first, then the
elements row by row.  Whitespace will be used as delimiters, so the board
can be specified as one long string or with newlines to appear as the final
board would.

== CALLING IT ==
The main program can be called in a number of ways:

	hidato.py
		will output a 6x6 hidato puzzle and solution, both in
		single-line format

	hidato.py -r 8 -c 5
		will output a hidato puzzle with 8 rows and 5 columns,
		both in single-line format

	hidato.py -F <name>
		will open the file <name>, presumably containing a
		hidato puzzle to solve, and will output the puzzle and
		solution in single-line format

	hidato.py -F <name> -d <1-5>
		will open the file <name>, presumably containing a
		hidato puzzle to solve, and will output the puzzle and
		solution (reached only using techniques appropriate for
		the requested difficulty level) in single-line format

	hidato.py -P <name>
		will open the file <name>, presumably containing a
		hidato board pattern to fill, and will output a new
		puzzle and its solution in single-line format

	hidato.py -P <name> -d <1-5>
		will open the file <name>, presumably containing a
		hidato board pattern to fill, and will output a new
		puzzle of the requested difficulty (1 being easiest,
		5 being hardest) and its solution in single-line format

So, the usage message will probably look like this:

USAGE:
        hidato [-D <severity>] [-r <row#> -c <column#>] [-d <1-5>]
		hidato [-D <severity>] -F <filename> [-d <1-5>]
		hidato [-D <severity>] -P <filename> [-d <1-5>]
